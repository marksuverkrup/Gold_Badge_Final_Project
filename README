Contained in this solution are three projects: Menu, Claims, and Badges

The Komodo Cafe introduces a new menu to the restaurant, giving the ability to create menu options,
delete these items off of the menu, and view a list of the entire menu, all through a simple,
easy to use console app.

The Komodo Claims Department takes things to a more serious level, dealing with accidents and claims.  
This console app will not only be able to view and add claims, but is also given the functionality of 
taking care of claims once they have been dealt with.  Truly an innovation for the insuracne community.

Last but certainly not least is the Komodo Insurace badging system.  Using some of the most difficult
methods known to the coding world at this time, this program elequently utilizes dictionaries in order to 
give and take permissions from employee badges.  This will allow only certain individuals to access
doors at the Komodo Insurance buildings, protecting the people, and improving their daily lives.


These three projects have been a culmination of the work done thus far in the Eleven Fifty Accademy.
I think I speak for all of us when I say it has been a pleasure designing these programs, 
and the partners over here at Dewee, Cheatum, and Howe look forward to working with you in the future.
